The orientations will cover version control, project planning, and how to 
effectively work on a team. The format will be a day long conference with 
workshops. There will be TWO dates offered, however, you only need to 
attend ONE. They will have the exact same content, but are offered on 
two different weekend days for your convenience.

9:30-12:00: Team Process Workshop
12:00-1:00: Lunch
